## Main Usecase

Pin what you want, update the rest—unlike `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` which update all or nothing.

## Key Features

- **Version pinning:** Use `~` or `^` for precise control
- **Package manager agnostic:** Works with npm, yarn, pnpm, bun
- **Monorepo support:** Single command across multiple packages

## Why This Matters

- Pin critical dependencies at specific versions
- Auto-update everything else to latest
- Maintain consistency across packages
- Automate in CI/CD
