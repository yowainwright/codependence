## Main Usecase

### Keep Dependencies Up-to-date

Codependence updates package.json's dependencies based on a "codependencies" array of dependency names. The difference from `{npm,pnpm,bun} update` or `yarn upgrade` is Codependence allows you to pin what you want and update the rest! Furthermore, Codependence works with monorepos and is package manager agnostic.

## Key Features

### Version Pinning Flexibility
Dependencies can be pinned to `~` or `^` versions in package.json files, giving you precise control over update ranges.

### Package Manager Agnostic
Works seamlessly with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun without requiring specific configuration.

### Monorepo Support
Handles multiple package.json files across your monorepo with a single command.

## Why This Matters

Traditional package managers update all dependencies or none. Codependence gives you the granular control to:
- Keep critical dependencies at specific versions
- Update everything else to latest
- Maintain consistency across multiple packages
- Automate updates in CI/CD pipelines
