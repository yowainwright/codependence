## Main Usecase

#### _Keep dependencies up-to-date_

Codependence updates package.json's dependencies based on a "codependencies" array of dependency names. The difference from `{npm,pnpm,bun} update` or `yarn upgrade` is Codependence allows you to pin what you want and update the rest! Furthermore, Codependence works with monorepos and is package manager agnostic.

> #### \*yes, dependencies can be pinned to `~` or `^` versions in package.json files!
