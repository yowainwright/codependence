# Recipes

Listed below are some common patterns (recipes) for using **Codependence**.

## Don't want a config? No problem!

Starting out, you may not want a config object. Have no fear, Codependence can be used as a CLI utility ONLY!

```sh
codependence --codependencies 'lodash' '{ \"fs-extra\": \"10.0.1\" }'
```

## Want to grab all dependencies which match a `<name>*` (name star) pattern to return the latest version of them? Sure!

```sh
codependence --codependencies '@foo/*' --update
```

## Want to update all dependencies to latest except specific ones? Use permissive mode!

```sh
codependence --codependencies 'react' 'lodash' --permissive --update
```

## Quick permissive setup with config

Create a `.codependencerc` with permissive mode:

```json
{
  "permissive": true,
  "codependencies": ["react", "@types/node"]
}
```

Then just run:

```sh
codependence --update
```
