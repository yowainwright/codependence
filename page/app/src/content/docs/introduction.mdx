## Introduction

**Codependence** is a JavaScript utility for checking specified `node_modules` are up-to-date or match a specified version.

## Synopsis

Codependence is a JavaScript utility CLI or node_module. It checks a project's **"codependencies"** in an array of strings that reference dependencies a project has listed in its `package.json` dependencies. 

Codependencies are a `package.json` and JavaScript ecosystem-specific concept. The naming convention for codependencies come from what may be the most important dependencies—a co-dependence that must be up-to-date or match a specific version to ensure your project works as expected. 

It compares the codependencies array to the project's current dependencies listed in one or more `package.json` files. It then parses over each dependency and validates the following:

- That each listed codependency is at latest or matches the specified version.

Codependence can either pass or fail CI based on these checks. It can also update the mismatched dependencies automatically to match the latest version or the specified version.

Codependence works alongside tools like [dependabot](https://dependabot.com). If a dependency is specified as a codependency, you can reliably ensure that project dependency is at a target version—a version you're project is tested to work with. This helps when tracking peerDependencies in projects and ensures they work as expected.

## Why use Codependence?

**Codependence** is a utility tool focused on a single task—managing specified dependency versions!

- **Made to be used with other tools:** Codependence complements tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), ensuring critical dependency versions meet specified requirements. 
- **Great for monorepos:** Codependence handles monorepos with ease by making sure multiple `package.json` files have dependencies that match specified versions.
- **Easy to add in CI:** Codependence can be run with a `package.json` npm script or GitHub action and fail or pass CI depending on whether the specified dependencies match the required versions.
- **Works with your current setup:** Integrate Codependence into your existing workflow using build pipeline tools like [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run Codependence before commits or pushes.

## Why not use Codependence?

While Codependence is a powerful tool for managing dependency versions, it might not be the right choice for every project:

- **You don't need intricate dependency version management.** If your project doesn't require strict version control for specific dependencies, Codependence might add unnecessary complexity.
- **You're happy with your current setup.** If you prefer using the latest versions, manual version pinning, or Dependabot's ignore specification, Codependence may not offer additional benefits.
