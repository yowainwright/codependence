## Synopsis

Codependence is a JavaScript utility CLI and node tool that compares a codependencies array against `package.json` dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies for **\*codependencies**.

For each dependency included in the codependencies array, Codependence will either **a)** check that versions are at latest or **b)** Check that a specified version is matched within package.json files. Codependence can either **a)** return a pass/fail result or **b)** update dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies, in package.json file(s).

---

Codependence is useful for ensuring specified dependencies are up-to-dateâ€”or at a specified version within a project's package.json files(s)!

This utility is built to work alongside dependency management tools like dependabot. It could work instead of dependency management tool but is built for managing specific dependency versions vs all dependencies.

---

#### \*Codependencies: are project dependencies which must be up-to-date or set to a specific version!

In example, if your repository requires the latest version and latest can't be specified as the dependency version within your package.json, Codependence will ensure your package.json has the **actual latest semver version** set in your `package.json`. It can/will do the same if an exact version is specified!
