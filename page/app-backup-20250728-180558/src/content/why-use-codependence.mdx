## Why use Codependence?

Codependence is a utility tool focused on a single taskâ€”managing specified dependency versions!

- It is built to work along side tools (like Dependabot) but it can also manage dependencies fully!
- It handles monorepos child package dependencies with ease and without package manager bias!
- It is as immediate as you want it to be, via npm install scripts and build pipeline tools, such as Husky
- It can be run along with npm scripts or in github actions
